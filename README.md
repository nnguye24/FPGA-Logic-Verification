# FPGA UART Transceiver w/ BRAM for device verification
### The Verilog code is for the Basys 3 FPGA board with Artix-7 chip. It utilizes the UART protocol to send logic inputs to a device under test. The DUT will send outputs back to the FPGA where the FPGA will verify if the correct outputs have been produced.
